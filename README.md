**Optimised simulator engine for NEURON**

CoreNEURON is a compute engine for the NEURON simulator optimised for both memory usage and computational speed. Its goal is to simulate large cell networks with small memory footprint and optimal performance.

**Blue Brain Simulation and Neural network Analysis Productivity layer (Blue Brain SNAP)**

Blue Brain SNAP is a Python library for accessing BlueBrain circuit models represented in SONATA format.

**Visualizer for large-scale and interactive ray-tracing of neurons**

Brayns is a minimalistic visualiser that can perform ray-traced rendering of neurons. It provides an abstraction of the underlying rendering engines, so that the best possible acceleration libraries can be used for the relevant hardware.

**The Blue Brain BioExplorer is a tool for scientists to extract and analyze scientific data for visualization and interactive exploration**

Exploration relies on building software that combines data integration, analysis and interactive visualization to build, modify and navigate through large scientific datasets. For this, Blue Brain built and open-sourced the Blue Brain BioExplorer. It was originally developed to answer key scientific questions related to the Coronavirus as a use case and to deliver a visualization tool. Today, the BioExplorer allows to reconstruct, visualize, explore and describe in detail the structure and function of highly-detailed biological structures such as molecular systems, neurons, astrocytes, blood vessels, and more. You can see the first application of the BioExplorer in [A Machine-Generated View of the Role of Blood Glucose Levels in the Severity of COVID-19](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.695139/full?utm_source=F-NTF&utm_medium=EMLX&utm_campaign=PRD_FEOPS_20170000_ARTICLE) study.
